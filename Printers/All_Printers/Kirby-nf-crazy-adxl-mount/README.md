# ADXL345 Mount for the NF Crazy hotend

- 2x M3x12, 2x M3x6(or M3x8)
- 2x short M3 Heatserts from the K3 BOM

Remove the M3 grub screws from the thermistor cartridge, then replace with M3x12 screws. Note that due to thermistor placement, one of the two screws will not be able to be tightened down all the way (acting as a grub screw for the thermistor). Don't go crazy or you'll break your thermistor.
